Library to RUN, PUBLISH and NOTIFY failures of Google Apps Script TESTS.

With GSTestRunner you can configure your CI for your Apps Script libraries, and also get status badges like the one above.

GSTestRunner is not to provide assertions. For that, we suggest the library [GSUnit](https://sites.google.com/site/scriptsexamples/custom-methods/gsunit).
