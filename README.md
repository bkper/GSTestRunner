Library to RUN, PUBLISH and send email NOTIFICATIONS of failures of [Google Apps Script] TESTS.

GSTestRunner helps with [TDD] and also set a lightweight [CI] for your GS code, and also get status badges like the one above.

GSTestRunner is not to provide assertions. For that, we suggest the library [GSUnit].
